    <h1>WebTech Project Proposal - Logan Hitchcock</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>What is your website about?</h2>
    <p>
      My website will aimed to be about exercising; mainly revolving around
      weight lifting. I will use different pages to outline exercises based on
      each muscle group.
    </p>
    <h2>What is the objective of your website?</h2>
    <p>
      The objective of my website is to give a one-stop shop for all ages to
      have a database of available exercises for each muscle group and a picture
      to demonstrate.
    </p>
    <h2>Who is your target audience?</h2>
    <p>
      My target audience is those who work out but do not neccessarily know
      exactly what to do in the gym.
    </p>
    <h2>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A homepage outlining the different muscle groups</li>
      <li>A different page for each muscle group</li>
      <li>At least 5 exercises for each muscle group</li>
      <li>Picture demonstrations for each of the exercises</li>
    </ul>
